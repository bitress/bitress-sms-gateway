# Bitress Android SMS Gateway

This project is still in-development.

Why? Deciding to build your own SMS gateway makes a lot of sense, especially for students working on capstone projects. SMS APIs can be expensive, and students might not have the budget for them. By creating a custom solution, it's not only more affordable, but it also allows students to explore and implement SMS features without worrying about costs getting in the way of their projects.

## Features
- Sending SMS
- Receive SMS to server
- Send a response to server
- Delivered notification to server
- Multiple SIM card
